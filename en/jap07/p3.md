**Calculation Process**

* Estimate the arrival value on the third rail.

* Select a possible point on the start rail and enter it into the formula.

* The formula brings the result for the value on the first rail. Now, using the cue, you imagine a line which connects the selected point on the start rail with the value on the first rail.

* If the cue ball is slightly beside this line, it can be shifted parallel until it crosses exactly the center of the cue ball. The point where this line reaches the first rail, is your aiming point.
