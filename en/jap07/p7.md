![](/files/J07.jpg)# How to Calculate Playing off B 2 Using an Example

**Instructions**

I, personally, would play the shown position according to my feeling, without calculating the aiming value on the first rail. You must also consider, that a little running English is applied to the cue ball caused by the cue ball touching B 2. Thus the value on the third rail can slightly increase. Despite this problem I want to point out that such a solution can also be calculated according to the system.

Before we start to calculate, we need to consider that we touch B 2 on the right hand side when we carry out the stroke. The cue ballâ€™s track after touching B 2 gives us the necessary values for the calculation. We must not consider the line which crosses the center of B 2, but the line which is one ball diameter to its right, because there is the actual path of the cue ball.

* Estimate the arrival on the third rail. In this example it is 14.

* Choose a possible start value and insert it into the formula. 30 - 14 = 16.

* The result of the calculation is the value on the first rail. Now imagine a line from the chosen start value to the value on the first rail. This line must be one ball diameter away from the center of B 2.

* The point where this line reaches the first rail is your aiming point.
