# The Calculation Formula

### 1st RAIL = START RAIL x 2nd RAIL

**Prerequisites of the Stroke**

The stroke is executed as standard stroke without English. B 1 is hit above center.

**Hints for the Calculation**

The formula itself is very easy, but sometimes it can produce quite complicated calculations like start value 2.6 x 2nd rail 3.7. The result is 9.62. If you are not very good at mental arithmetics, you must look for other strategies. An approximate result is also good enough, since already aiming at half units is quite a challenge. That means if I aim at 9.5 or 9.8 does not make a huge difference.

**Strategy for People Who Are Good at Mental Arithmetics**

Do not consider the comma when calculating, meaning calculate 26 x 37. In order to do so you can first calculate 20 x 37 which equals 740 and then 6 x 37 which equals 222, if you then add 740 to 222 you receive 962 as a result, considering the comma it is 9.62.

**Strategy for People Who Are not so Good at Mental Arithmetics**

You could first calculate 2 x 3.7 = 7.4 and 3 x 3.7 = 11.1 and then choose the average of these two results (knowing that 2.6 is not exactly the average of 2 and 3, the accuracy is sufficient).

**Strategy for People Who Are Bad at Mental Arithmetics**

The multiplication of whole numbers will not be a problem for anybody. For the multiplication of half values you can prepare a table and learn the results by heart. For our calculation of 2.6 x 3.7 this means: for reasons of simplicity you should first use the result of the calculation of 2.5 x 3.5 which is 8.75 according to the table. 3.7 is approx. half way between 3.5 and 4, thus I calculate 2.5 x 4 = 10. The aiming value therefore is half way between 8.75 and 10, approx. 9.4, which only differs minimally from the correct result of 9.62. Of course there are also other strategies to come close to the correct result, just be creative!

|   | 1.5  | 2.5  | 3.5  | 4.5  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5  | 2.25  | 3.75  | 5.25  | 6.75  |
| 2.5 | 3.75  | 6.25  | 8.75  | 11.25  |
| 3.5  | 5.25  | 8.75  | 12.25  | 15.75  |
| 4.5  | 6.75  | 11.25  | 15.75  | 20.25  |
