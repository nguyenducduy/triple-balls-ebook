# Example for the Calculation

**Instructions**

* Estimate the arrival value on the second rail. We receive a value of 4.

* Select a possible point on the start rail and enter it into the formula. 2nd rail 4 x start rail 2.2 = 1st rail 8.8.

* The formula brings the result for the value on the first rail. Now, using the cue, you imagine a line which connects the selected point on the start rail (2.2) with the value on the first rail (8.8). If you find that the point on the start rail which you selected in step 2 produces a line after entering into the formula, which is clearly further than 5 cm away from the cue ball, you must select a point on the start rail which is more suitable and enter this one into the formula.

* If the cue ball is slightly beside this line, it can be shifted parallel until it crosses exactly the center of the cue ball. The point where this line reaches the first rail, is your aiming point.
