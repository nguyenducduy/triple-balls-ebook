\# The Numbering



Start Rail

    The values on the start rail relate to the points on the wooden rail \(see dashed line\).



    The values increase regularly per diamond by 10 points.



1st Rail

    The values on the first rail relate to the points on the wooden rail \(see dashed line\).



    The values increase per each half of a diamond by 10 points between 20 and 50. Between 50 and 90 the values increase per each quarter of a diamond by 10 points. Between the special zone 0 and 20 is half a diamond.



3rd Rail

    The values of the third rail relate to the values on the front part of the rubber, vertical to the value on the wooden rail.



    The values increase regularly per diamond by 10 points and are positioned exactly opposite of the starting point with the corresponding value.
