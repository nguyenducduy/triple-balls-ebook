# A Training Plan for the Plus System

The Plus System is divided into different zones. I strongly suggest not to deal with the next zone, until you have mastered the previous one.

**The Single Steps
**
### Zone 1: Start Value between 20 and 60
    1. Learn the numbering of the start, first and third rail by heart.
    2. Learn the formula and practice calculations.
    3. Know and practice the requirements of the stroke.
    4. Play example calculations and strictly obey the sequence of the steps. Explore the tricky zones.
    5. Create your own examples.
    

### Zone 2: Start Value between 0 and 80, Aiming Value of 0 or 00
    1. Learn the correction values by heart if you aim at 0.
    2. Know and practice the requirements of the stroke.
    3. Learn the correction values by heart if you aim at 00.
    4. Know and practice the prerequisites of the stroke and compare them with the training strokes when aiming at 0.
    5. Play example calculations.
    6. Create your own examples.

### Zone 3: Start Value between 0 and 20, Arrival at 3rd Rail up to 40
    1. Learn the new numbering of the first rail by heart.
    2. Know and practice the requirements of the stroke.
    3. Play example calculations.
    4. Create your own examples.

### Zone 4: Start Value between 10 and 20, Arrival at 3rd Rail from 40 to 80
    1. Learn the new numbering of the first rail by heart, when coming from 10 and coming from 20.
    2. Know and practice the requirements of the stroke.
    3. Play example calculations.
    4. Create your own examples.

### Zone 5: Start Value between 60 and 80, Arrival at 3rd Rail from 60 to 120
    1. Learn the new numbering of the first rail and the little extension on the arrival rail by heart.
    2. Know and practice the requirements of the stroke.
    3. Play example calculations.
    4. Create your own examples.

### Last Steps
    * Learn the tracks to the fourth rail.
    * Create many examples on your own for all zones and play them.
