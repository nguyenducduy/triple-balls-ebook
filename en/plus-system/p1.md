# Usage

### Description

The Plus System is used for the patterns Short-Long-Long. Since there are some problematic zones and correction values, it is quite complex and requires much training and experience and following a detailed training plan in order to generate satisfying results.

You can find the Plus System in different billiard books, e.g. Raymond Ceulemans’, Walt Harris’, Robert Byrne’s or Gerhard Hüpper’s. I made some adaptions in order to improve the accuracy in some areas.

**Vulnerability to Differences in the Material**

* The sensitivity to differences in the material is not very big in the Plus System. Additionally, you integrate the characteristics of the table into the system using a test stroke.

* Only the deflection from the third rail, resp. the track to the fourth rail shows significant differences and requires some experience.
